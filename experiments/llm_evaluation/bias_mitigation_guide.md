# LLM Evaluation Bias Mitigation Guide

## üö® The Problem: Self-Evaluation Bias

When the same model that generates answers also judges their correctness, several biases emerge:

### Types of Bias
1. **Self-Evaluation Bias**: Models rate their own outputs favorably
2. **Consistency Bias**: Judging based on own reasoning patterns  
3. **Format Bias**: Preferring own output style
4. **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking supporting evidence

### Impact on Results
- ‚ùå Inflated accuracy scores (94.4% vs realistic 85-87%)
- ‚ùå Overconfident predictions
- ‚ùå Poor error detection calibration
- ‚ùå Unreliable performance metrics

## ‚úÖ The Solution: Multi-Model Judge System

### Implementation
```python
# Instead of this (biased):
judgment = same_model.judge(same_model.answer)

# Use this (unbiased):
judgments = [
    gpt4_judge.evaluate(model_answer),
    claude_judge.evaluate(model_answer), 
    gpt35_judge.evaluate(model_answer)
]
final_judgment = majority_vote(judgments)
```

### Judge Model Selection
- **Primary Judges**: GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3-Haiku, GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Criteria**: Different providers, proven reliability, cost-effective
- **Rotation**: Rotate judges to prevent systematic bias

### Evaluation Process
1. **Independent Evaluation**: Each judge evaluates separately
2. **Majority Voting**: Final decision based on consensus
3. **Consensus Tracking**: Monitor agreement levels
4. **Bias Detection**: Compare with self-evaluation results

## üìä Expected Improvements

### Accuracy Calibration
- More realistic performance metrics
- Better identification of actual capabilities
- Improved error detection

### Confidence Calibration  
- Reduced overconfidence
- Better uncertainty quantification
- More reliable confidence scores

### Manufacturing Domain Benefits
- Accurate assessment of data quality handling
- Reliable cross-system validation metrics
- Trustworthy compliance verification results

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps

1. **Set up judge models** with different providers
2. **Create unbiased evaluation prompts** 
3. **Implement majority voting system**
4. **Track consensus and disagreement**
5. **Compare with self-evaluation results**
6. **Generate bias analysis reports**

## üìà Monitoring and Validation

### Key Metrics
- **Consensus Score**: Agreement level among judges
- **Bias Magnitude**: Difference from self-evaluation
- **Controversial Decisions**: Cases with judge disagreement
- **Calibration Error**: Confidence vs actual accuracy

### Red Flags
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Accuracy > 95% (likely overestimated)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Perfect error detection (100%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Uniform confidence scores (std < 0.1)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No performance degradation on corrupted data

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Always use external judges** for final evaluation
2. **Rotate judge models** to prevent systematic bias
3. **Track consensus levels** to identify controversial cases
4. **Compare with human baselines** when possible
5. **Document bias analysis** in all evaluation reports

Remember: The goal is accurate assessment, not high scores!
