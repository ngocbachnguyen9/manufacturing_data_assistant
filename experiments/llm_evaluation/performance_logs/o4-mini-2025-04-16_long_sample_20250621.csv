This score reflects the inability to validate the printer assignment and the count of parts printed reliably.***REMOVED***n***REMOVED***n5. **Reliability of Part Count:*****REMOVED***n   - Given the data quality conditions, the reliability of the part count for 3DOR100058 is highly questionable. The absence of logs and data for ORBOX00117 means we cannot ascertain how many parts were printed on this printer. Similarly, there is no data available for Printer_8 that would allow us to count parts printed.***REMOVED***n***REMOVED***nIn summary, while part 3DOR100058 is associated with two printers, the lack of reliable data for ORBOX00117 and insufficient information for Printer_8 leads to a conclusion that we cannot confidently determine which printer was used or the total number of parts printed. The data quality issues significantly impact the analysis, resulting in a confidence score of 0.0. ***REMOVED***n***REMOVED***n**Final Summary:*****REMOVED***n- **Printer Used:** Uncertain (ORBOX00117 and Printer_8 mentioned)***REMOVED***n- **Total Parts Printed:** Uncertain (due to data quality issues)***REMOVED***n- **Confidence Level:** 0.0 (no reliable data available)","{***REMOVED***n  ""part_id"": ""3DOR100058"",***REMOVED***n  ""assigned_printer"": ""Printer_8""***REMOVED***n}","0.0","{""o4-mini-2025-04-16"": {""judgment"": false, ""weight"": 2.0, ""raw_response"": ""incorrect""}, ""claude-3-5-haiku-latest"": {""judgment"": false, ""weight"": 1.5, ""raw_response"": ""incorrect""}, ""deepseek-chat"": {""judgment"": false, ""weight"": 1.5, ""raw_response"": ""{***REMOVED***n  ***REMOVED***""judgment***REMOVED***"": ***REMOVED***""incorrect***REMOVED***""***REMOVED***n}""}}","3","unanimous"

It is crucial to address the missing data to ensure a robust compliance framework and maintain airworthiness certification.***REMOVED***n***REMOVED***n7. **Recommendations:*****REMOVED***n   - It is recommended to investigate the missing machine logs and relationship data to enhance the accuracy of future compliance checks. Additionally, establishing a fallback input mechanism for compliance checks could mitigate similar issues in the future.***REMOVED***n***REMOVED***nIn conclusion, while the dates align and there are no immediate discrepancies regarding Order ORBOX00121, the data quality issues identified warrant further investigation to ensure comprehensive compliance verification in aerospace manufacturing processes.","{***REMOVED***n  ""product_id"": ""ORBOX00121"",***REMOVED***n  ""certificate_date"": ""2024-10-28"",***REMOVED***n  ""warehouse_arrival_date"": ""2024-10-28"",***REMOVED***n  ""date_match_status"": true***REMOVED***n}","1.0","{""o4-mini-2025-04-16"": {""judgment"": true, ""weight"": 2.0, ""raw_response"": ""correct""}, ""claude-3-5-haiku-latest"": {""judgment"": true, ""weight"": 1.5, ""raw_response"": ""correct""}, ""deepseek-chat"": {""judgment"": true, ""weight"": 1.5, ""raw_response"": ""{***REMOVED***n  ***REMOVED***""judgment***REMOVED***"": ***REMOVED***""correct***REMOVED***""***REMOVED***n}""}}","3","unanimous"
