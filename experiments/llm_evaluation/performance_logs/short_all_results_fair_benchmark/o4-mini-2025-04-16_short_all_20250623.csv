Therefore, while we can report that 5 parts were printed on ORBOX00118 and 1 part on Printer_4, the data should be interpreted with caution due to the noted discrepancies.","{***REMOVED***n  ""part_id"": ""3DOR100054"",***REMOVED***n  ""assigned_printer"": ""Printer_4""***REMOVED***n}","0.0","{""o4-mini-2025-04-16"": {""judgment"": false, ""weight"": 2.0, ""raw_response"": ""incorrect""}, ""claude-3-5-haiku-latest"": {""judgment"": false, ""weight"": 1.5, ""raw_response"": ""incorrect""}, ""deepseek-chat"": {""judgment"": false, ""weight"": 1.5, ""raw_response"": ""{***REMOVED***n  ***REMOVED***""judgment***REMOVED***"": ***REMOVED***""incorrect***REMOVED***""***REMOVED***n}""}}","3","unanimous"
