============================================================

## Executive Summary

This evaluation used multiple unbiased judge models to eliminate self-evaluation bias.

## Judge System Configuration

- **gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18**: Weight 1
- **deepseek-chat**: Weight 1
- **claude-3-haiku-20240307**: Weight 1

## Consensus Analysis

**Total Tasks Evaluated**: 90
**Average Consensus Score**: 0.630
**Unanimous Decisions**: 40/90 (44.4%)
**Majority Decisions**: 68/90 (75.6%)

## Bias Elimination Benefits

✅ **Self-Evaluation Bias Eliminated**: Different models judge the answers
✅ **Weighted Consensus**: Higher-capability judges have more influence
✅ **Transparency**: All individual judgments are recorded
✅ **Reliability**: Multiple perspectives reduce individual model biases

## Controversial Decisions (Split Judgments)

## Methodology Validation

This unbiased evaluation system addresses the critical flaw in self-evaluation:

❌ **Previous (Biased)**: deepseek-chat judges its own answers
✅ **Current (Unbiased)**: GPT-4o-mini, deepseek-reasoner, Claude judge deepseek-chat's answers

This provides more accurate, reliable performance metrics for manufacturing data analysis tasks.
