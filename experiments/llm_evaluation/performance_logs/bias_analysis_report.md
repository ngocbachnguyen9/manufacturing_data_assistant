# Balanced LLM Evaluation - Judge Analysis Report
============================================================

## Executive Summary

This evaluation used 3 balanced judges with weighted consensus to eliminate self-evaluation bias.

## Judge System Configuration

- **o4-mini-2025-04-16**: Weight 2.0 (high reasoning)
- **claude-3-5-haiku-latest**: Weight 1.5 (fast)
- **deepseek-chat**: Weight 1.5 (fast)

## Consensus Analysis

**Total Tasks Evaluated**: 9
**Average Consensus Score**: 0.911
**Unanimous Decisions**: 7/9 (77.8%)
**Majority Decisions**: 9/9 (100.0%)

## Bias Elimination Benefits

✅ **Self-Evaluation Bias Eliminated**: Independent judges evaluate the answers
✅ **Balanced Approach**: High-reasoning judge + fast judges for speed/accuracy balance
✅ **Weighted Consensus**: Higher weight for reasoning judge, majority threshold
✅ **Transparency**: All individual judgments and weights are recorded

## Controversial Decisions (Split Judgments)

- **P1_task_8**: Consensus 0.60
- **P6_task_10**: Consensus 0.60

## Methodology Validation

This unbiased evaluation system addresses the critical flaw in self-evaluation:

❌ **Previous (Biased)**: Model judges its own answers
✅ **Current (Balanced)**: 3 independent judges with weighted consensus judge all model answers

This provides more accurate, reliable performance metrics for manufacturing data analysis tasks.
